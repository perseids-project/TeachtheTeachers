Teach the Teachers, Leipzig April 18-19th, 2016
The Perseids Project, in collaboration with the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig and the Department of Classics at Tufts University is calling for participants in the first Teach the Teachers workshop. The two-day workshop aims to present and develop lesson plans and syllabi including digital methods for the high school and university Humanities curriculum. Registration for the workshop will be free and financial support for travel and lodging will be provided. We are looking for participants who teach at the High School or Secondary school level, as well as PhD candidates and Graduate Students.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the field of classical studies continues to evolve, technology is playing a larger and larger and larger role both in the interpretation of data, but the in the education of a new generation of scholars. As people begin to use these tools to teach Greek and Latin, it is important that we come together and share our experiences, strategies, and ideas. Moreover, this workshop will offer educators who are unfamiliar with newer digital tools and their use in the classroom, to learn from fellow educators the best techniques for their implementation.</span>

The workshop will contain seminars on how to use the tools available via Perseids, in particular the Alpheios Alignment editor and the Arethusa Treebank editor. These seminars will include comprehensive guidelines so that any user at any level of digital literacy will be able to use the tools to their full potential. This will include, but is not limited too:
<ul>
	<li>Use of <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/perseids/projects/breaking-the-language-barrier/">translation alignments</a> for non-language students</li>
	<li>Use of <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/perseids/publications/treebank-publications/">treebank annotations</a> to assess understanding of grammar and morpho-syntax</li>
	<li>Use of the gold standard review functionality and the board review systems of Perseids</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/perseids/news-and-updates/journey-of-the-hero/">Perseids Social</a> network annotation workflow</li>
	<li>Assessment strategies for digital assignments</li>
</ul>
The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate the exchange of new ideas for the implementation of the Perseids Platform in the classroom. During the two-day workshop we will produce resources for digital projects in a classroom setting. We will incorporate these resources into a growing collection of shared resources which will help future educators integrate the Perseids to their classroom practice.Those resources may include:
<ul>
	<li>Syllabi for high school and college level courses.</li>
	<li>Lesson plans for in-class digital projects.</li>
	<li>collaborative, inter-institutional workflows and project plans</li>
</ul>
